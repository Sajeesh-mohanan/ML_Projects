# 🤖 ML_Projects

A collection of beginner-to-intermediate machine learning projects focused on real-world problem solving using Python.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. 📉 STOCK PRICE PREDICTION
Predicts future stock prices using machine learning models like Linear Regression. Involves data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

### 2. 🐦 TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS (NLP)
Performs sentiment classification (positive/negative) on tweets using NLP techniques and logistic regression. Includes data cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, and model training.

### 3. 🧠 Sentiment Scraper: Real-Time Web Sentiment Analysis with Transformers
This project demonstrates how to build a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline using Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and BeautifulSoup. The notebook fetches content from the web, processes it, and classifies the sentiment using a pre-trained NLP model.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NLTK
- Transformers
- BERT
- Jupyter Notebook
